# Journal — Session State Capture

## Purpose

Record working state at session boundaries so future sessions can reconstruct context without manual re-explanation. Fills the gap between ephemeral conversation context and permanent knowledge base entries.

"If it isn't written down, sir, it didn't happen — or at any rate, you won't remember that it did." — Alfred

## Safety Constraints

### NEVER
- Include secrets, credentials, or sensitive data
- Overwrite an existing journal entry (each session gets its own file)
- Write journal entries for trivial sessions (quick questions, no meaningful state to capture)
- Block the user from ending their session to write a journal

### ALWAYS
- Auto-detect branch name and timestamp from the environment
- Auto-fill from conversation context where possible (minimize user effort)
- Verify the journal file was written correctly
- Keep entries concise — scannable in <10 seconds

## Known Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Recovery |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Directory doesn't exist | First journal entry or memory cleanup | Create `memory/sessions/` directory |
| Timestamp collision | Two sessions in the same minute | Append `-2` suffix to filename |
| Sparse entry | Session was short or exploratory | Still write it — even "explored X, decided not to pursue" is valuable |
| Stale context | Compaction happened mid-session | Gather what's available; note gaps in the entry |

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Environment

Collect automatically:
1. **Timestamp**: Current date and time (`date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M`)
2. **Branch**: Current git branch (`git branch --show-current`)
3. **Filename**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md` derived from timestamp

### Step 2: Synthesize Session State

From conversation context, gather:
1. **Summary**: 2-3 sentence overview of what happened this session
2. **Changes**: Files modified/created with one-line descriptions
3. **Decisions**: Key choices made and their rationale
4. **Next**: What to pick up next, open questions, blockers

Auto-fill where possible. Ask the user only for what can't be inferred.

### Step 3: Write Journal Entry

Create the file at: `memory/sessions/{YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM}.md`

Format:
```yaml
---
date: {ISO timestamp}
branch: {branch-name}
tags: [session-journal, {relevant-tags}]
---
```

Followed by:
```markdown
## Summary
{2-3 sentences}

## Changes
- `path/to/file` — What changed

## Decisions
- **Decision**: Rationale

## Next
- What to do next
- Open questions
- Blockers
```

### Step 4: Verify Entry

Read back the created file to confirm correctness. Report success with file path.

### Step 5: Offer Memory Updates (Optional)

If stable patterns emerged during the session, offer to update MEMORY.md or topic files. This is a suggestion, not automatic.

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Timestamp and branch auto-detected
- [ ] All four sections populated (Summary, Changes, Decisions, Next)
- [ ] File written to `memory/sessions/` with valid YAML frontmatter
- [ ] File read back and verified

### Verification Commands
```bash
ls memory/sessions/*.md | sort -r | head -1
grep "session-journal" memory/sessions/*.md | tail -1
```
