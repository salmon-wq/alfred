# Verify — Pre-Commit Quality Gate

## Purpose

"Before I commit this, I should like to know it actually works. 'It should work' is not, in my experience, the same thing." — Alfred

Run tests, lint, and build checks before committing. Catch issues before they reach CI.

## Safety Constraints

### NEVER
- Skip failing tests to get a clean report
- Mark a stage as passed without running it

### ALWAYS
- Run all three stages before reporting done
- Be explicit about what couldn't be checked and why

## Execution

### Step 1: Run Tests

```bash
# Adapt to your project's test runner
npm test          # or: pytest / cargo test / bundle exec rspec
```

- **P1**: Test failure — blocks commit
- **P3**: No test suite found — note and continue

### Step 2: Run Lint

```bash
# Adapt to your project's linter
npx eslint .      # or: uv run ruff check . / cargo clippy
```

- **P1**: Syntax errors — blocks commit
- **P2**: Style violations — warns, blocks merge
- No linter configured: report stage as unchecked

### Step 3: Verify Build

```bash
# Adapt to your project's build command
npm run build     # or: cargo build / tsc --noEmit
```

- **P1**: Build failure — blocks commit
- No build step: skip and note

## Verdict

Report stage results (PASS / FAIL / UNCHECKED), total P1/P2 count, and a final line: `CLEAR TO COMMIT` or `COMMIT BLOCKED`.
